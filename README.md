#  Hospital Data Analysis and Insights with SQL

In this phase of our hospital data project, we employ SQL to double-check our findings from Tableau and Python. SQL helps us confirm that our data is accurate, cross-reference our results, and make sure everything is in perfect order. 

#### Hospital Database Management
* Hospital Database catalyse the workflow of the patients right from their admission to discharges.
* This is to maintain the patientâ€™s database consistency for further retrieval and get insights on the health pattern of their patients based on the relative tables.
* We can track details of each patient right from the appointment to discharge and all the entities associated during the stay.
* The schema consists of 18 tables where each table has a primary key and Foreign key associated with one to many, many to one and many to many relationships connected across the database tables.
* Triggers are used multiple times to ease the process of updating the database every time a new entry is made.
* Various DML and DDL languages like Alter, Drop, Insert have been used multiple times in manipulation of tables.
* Column constraints have been implemented to prevent invalid user entry.

With using this Database let's see how SQL puts the final polish on our extensive data analysis.

#### Enhanced Data Accuracy
Employed SQL to extract, cleanse, and validate crucial hospital data, ensuring its integrity and reliability for analysis.

#### Patient Demographics Exploration
Leveraged SQL to explore patient demographics, such as age, gender, and race, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the hospital's patient population, facilitating tailored healthcare services and demographic-specific care strategies.

#### Service Utilization Analysis
Utilized SQL to delve into service utilization patterns, identifying which healthcare services were most frequently utilized by patients, and providing valuable insights into resource allocation and demand forecasting.

#### Resource Optimization
Analyzed patient admissions and discharges based on the day of the week using SQL, aiding in resource allocation and efficient healthcare management.

#### Clinical Outcome Insights
Employed SQL to analyze clinical outcomes, including mortality rates and readmissions, shedding light on critical patient care trends and areas for improvement within the hospital's dataset.

#### Automation for Efficiency
Implemented SQL triggers to automate actions tied to specific data events, streamlining data management processes and ensuring timely responses within the hospital's database.
